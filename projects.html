            <h2>Medical Kits for Daggerfall Unity</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>
                Adds a new item to Daggerfall Unity. The item has custom funcionality that relies on the players current medical skills and some related attributes to determine 
                how much health is restored and how long it takes to heal. Generally, those with a high medical skill will heal more and spend less time using the kit. Along with 
                this, a higher medical skill results in more efficient usage of the kits and allows for additional functionality such as treating diseases and poisons.

            <h2>Random Magical Trinkets for Daggerfall Unity</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>
                Adds a luck-based loot system to Daggerfall Unity. Based upon the player's luck, a random trinket (weapon, armor, clothing, or jewelry) has a chance to 
                generate on slain enemies and in dungeon loot piles. Depending on how lucky they are, the item can be of a higher quality, resulting in the item having more 
                effects and said effects being stronger. The effects are randomly chosen on generation, meaning that depending on pure chance, a player could potentially 
                receive a powerful trinket with a combination of useful effects.

            <hr>

            <p>
                Used Python to work on the data from the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-case-surveillance-public-use-data" target="_blank">COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data</a>. Graphs were created after manipulating the data. A Web Application
                was written for users to more easily select and view which graphs they wanted.
                <br><br>

                The Web Page for the graphs can be found <a href="python_Data_Analysis_Web_App/covidHome.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
                <br><br> 
                
                The script used to work with the data along with a GUI Application to use the script's functions can be found <a href="https://github.com/VenomSoro/Covid-Analysis-Python-App/tree/main" target="_blank">here</a>.
