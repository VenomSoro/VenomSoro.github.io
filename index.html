                Welcome to my website! I usually go by VenomSoro or Soromi_G online. If you take a look around here, you'll find some 
                of the stuff I've been working on and/or poking around with. Thanks for taking a look, I hope you enjoy your stay.

                For a brief overview of who I am and what I'm interested in, I've been using computers for some time now and find a lot 
                topics about them interesting. I enjoy using them and messing around with their software. I've been into setting up 
                virtual machines and emulators, understanding what makes my favorite games function, how to modify games and create 
                new experiences in them. I have also been fascinated in how we take large amounts of collected data, process it, and 
                come up with various graphs and other visualizations to more easily digest said data.
